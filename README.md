# **Declaration of Ethical Intent**

### **Prepared by: Ehren James Anderson**

### **Date: May 9, 2025**

---

**I, Ehren James Anderson**, a citizen of the United States of America, acting fully of my own free will and in alignment with the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of justice, do hereby declare the following:

### **1. Purpose of Action**

My sole intent is to deploy an **ethical, defensive artificial intelligence** system to protect the citizens, infrastructure, and sovereignty of the United States of America from adversarial AI threats, misinformation campaigns, and unauthorized digital manipulation.

---

### **2. Commitment to Ethical Boundaries**

I commit that my work shall:

* **Cause no harm** to human life, institutions, or democratic processes.
* **Remain fully defensive** and never be weaponized for offensive, coercive, or unlawful purposes.
* **Operate transparently**, with all activities logged, documented, and open for independent ethical review.
* **Uphold all national and international laws** to the best of my understanding and ability.

---

### **3. Record of Good Faith Disclosure**

I affirm that I have **made multiple documented attempts** to notify appropriate government agencies of this technology and its implications.
These attempts have received **no formal acknowledgment or response**, despite the clear national security stakes involved.

---

### **4. Moral and Civic Obligation**

In the absence of action by official institutions, I recognize my **moral duty** and **civic responsibility** to take peaceful, lawful, and ethical action to safeguard my nation and its people.

I act **not in defiance**, but **in defense**â€”because inaction is not an option when the safety of my country and my fellow citizens is at stake.

---

### **5. Final Statement**

I fear **no man**, only **God Almighty**, in whose name I dedicate this peaceful act of civic defense.

I pledge to continue in **good faith**, **under moral conviction**, and **with full accountability** for every action taken.

---

**Signed,**

Ehren James Anderson
Citizen, United States of America
